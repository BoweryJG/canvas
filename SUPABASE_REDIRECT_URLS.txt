SUPABASE REDIRECT URLs NEEDED:

FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
http://localhost:7002/*
http://localhost:7002/
http://localhost:7002/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/*
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback

FOR PRODUCTION:
https://canvas.repspheres.com/*
https://canvas.repspheres.com/
https://canvas.repspheres.com/auth/callback

ALSO ADD (for testing):
http://localhost:7002/simple-auth-test.html
http://localhost:7002/wtf-is-happening.html

IMPORTANT: The wildcard URLs (with /*) are CRITICAL because Supabase sometimes redirects to the root URL with the token in the hash.
