I hope this email finds you well. My name is ${salesRepInfo.name} from ${salesRepInfo.company}, and I've been researching practices like yours that are making significant impacts in patient care.

${practiceInfo ? `I noticed your ${practiceInfo.toLowerCase().replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '')}. ` : ''}${techAdoption ? `Your practice's ${techAdoption.toLowerCase().replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '')} particularly caught my attention, as it shows you're committed to delivering the best possible care to your patients.` : ''}

${keyBuyingSignal ? keyBuyingSignal.replace('ðŸ’¡', 'Based on my research,') : `I believe ${salesRepInfo.product} could be a valuable addition to your practice.`}

${scanResult.salesBrief.split('.')[0]}.

I'd love to schedule a brief 15-minute call to discuss how ${salesRepInfo.product} has helped similar practices:
â€¢ Increase efficiency by 30-40%
â€¢ Improve patient satisfaction scores
â€¢ Generate additional revenue streams

Would you be available for a quick conversation next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon?

Best regards,
${salesRepInfo.name}
${salesRepInfo.company}

P.S. I've prepared a customized analysis showing exactly how ${salesRepInfo.product} could benefit your specific practice. I'd be happy to share this during our call.`;

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about ${salesRepInfo.product}.

I've been working with several practices in your area, and the results have been remarkable:
â€¢ Dr. Smith saw a 45% reduction in administrative time
â€¢ Dr. Johnson increased patient throughput by 35%
â€¢ Multiple practices reported ROI within 60 days

Given your practice's ${scanResult.score}% alignment score with our most successful implementations, I'm confident we could achieve similar or better results.

I've blocked out some time this week specifically for consultations. Would a 10-minute call on Thursday work for you?

Looking forward to connecting,
${salesRepInfo.name}

P.S. I can also share a case study from a practice very similar to yours during our call.`;

I hope I haven't been too persistent in reaching out. I'm genuinely excited about the potential impact ${salesRepInfo.product} could have on your practice.

This is my final email, but I wanted to share one last opportunity:

We're offering a limited-time incentive for practices like yours:
â€¢ 20% discount on implementation
â€¢ Free training for your entire staff
â€¢ 90-day money-back guarantee
â€¢ Priority support for the first year

This offer expires at the end of this week.

${scanResult.salesBrief.split('.').slice(-1)[0].trim()}.

If you're interested, I can send over a brief proposal that outlines everything. No call necessary - just reply with "SEND PROPOSAL" and I'll get it to you right away.

All the best,
${salesRepInfo.name}

P.S. Even if the timing isn't right, I'd be happy to keep you updated on industry trends and best practices. Just let me know.`;
