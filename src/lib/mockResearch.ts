    salesBrief: `**TACTICAL SALES BRIEF**

**1. PRACTICE OVERVIEW**
Dr. Gregory White runs Pure Dental, a cutting-edge oral surgery center in Williamsville specializing in full arch implants and complex procedures. The practice features dual CBCT units, digital workflows, and in-house 3D printing, positioning them as technology leaders in the Buffalo market.

**2. OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS**
â€¢ **Integration Gap**: While they have premium individual systems (Carestream CBCT, iTero, Eaglesoft), there's an opportunity to unify their digital workflow
â€¢ **Growth Management**: Recent expansion with second CBCT shows growth - they need scalable solutions for increasing patient volume
â€¢ **AI Enhancement**: Already implementing AI planning, indicating openness to advanced automation and efficiency tools

**3. RECOMMENDED APPROACH**
Schedule a brief 15-minute demo focused on workflow integration and efficiency gains. Lead with how your solution complements their existing Eaglesoft/CBCT setup. Emphasize ROI through time savings in treatment planning and case presentation. Best timing is early Q1 when they're planning annual technology investments. Prepare case studies from similar high-tech oral surgery practices.`
